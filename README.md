# CargoTracking

A real-time shipment monitoring and notification system for logistics companies and end users.

## üöÄ Overview

CargoTracking is a distributed logistics application built with a **microservices architecture** using modern technologies. It enables users to create, track, and manage cargo shipments with live location updates and instant status change notifications.

This project is designed to demonstrate scalable architecture, event-driven communication, real-time data flow, and DevOps best practices.

## üìÅ Microservices

| Service             | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `ShipmentService`   | Manages shipment creation and updates |
| `TrackingService`   | Consumes Kafka messages, caches locations |
| `NotificationService` | Listens from RabbitMQ and sends real-time updates |
| `UI (React)`        | Provides user interface for shipment management |
| `API Gateway`       | (Planned) Reverse proxy for services |
